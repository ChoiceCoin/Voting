## The OSS Developer Reward Bash
  The aim of this bash is to build a platform through which we can reward Active Participants of the Choice-coin Open Source Development Community. This application allows multiple transactions to be submitted at one Click. Unlike Atomic Transfer, If any of the transactions fail, not all the transactions will fail But only the onces(account) with the error. That is, this DAPP allows simultaneous execution of multiple transfers of all kinds of assets in one click.
