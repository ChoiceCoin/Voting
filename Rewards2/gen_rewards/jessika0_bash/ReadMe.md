## 🤯 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Using a pandas to read the csv file into a list and a while loop loopint through the lists grabbing the from and amount variable and carrying out the transactions
## 🪄 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

This can be implemented as a means to distribute rewards in a voting system whereby algoexplorer is been scraped to get the from and amount vairables and this script does the math and distributes the rewards.
