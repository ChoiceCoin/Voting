## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>


- IDEAL: Getting data from the Algoexplorer should be easy, reliable and efficient, it should not hav edown times and should be available 24/7
- REALITY: The reality is that sometimes there are downtimes when using the algoexplorer api or any API and one might end up struck while trying to query the required data at a specific time
- CONSEQUENCES: This downtime caused by the unreliablity of Api's can casue you to have outdated and unrelaible data when needed the most, and can result in loss of trust and reliability of your platform


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Using a webscraper scraper to collect this on chain data is proven to be cheaper and at times more reliable

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.
