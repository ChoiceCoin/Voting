# Atomic Transfer

This simply means that transactions that are part of the transfer either all succeed or all fail. Atomic transfers allow complete strangers to trade assets without the need for a trusted intermediary, all while guaranteeing that each party will receive what they agreed to.

## Use cases

Atomic transfers enable use cases such as:

Circular trades - Alice pays Bob if and only if Bob pays Claire if and only if Claire pays Alice.

Group payments - Everyone pays or no one pays.

Decentralized exchanges - Trade one asset for another without going through a centralized exchange.

Distributed payments - Payments to multiple recipients.

Pooled transaction fees - One transaction pays the fees of others.
