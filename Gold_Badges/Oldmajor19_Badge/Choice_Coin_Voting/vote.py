# This code defines a decenteralized voting system on the Algorand Blockchain.
# It uses Choice Coin, an Algorand Standard Asset, to record votes on a distributed ledger.
# The system makes both efficiency and security a priority.
# An escrow account holds the total number of Choice Coin required for the voting process, and Algorand accounts for each of the decisions are made.
# Each of the individual decisions made by the voters connect back to the escrow account.
# In turn, one Choice Coin transfers to the appropriate decision account through a stateless smart contract.
# Furthermore, a SHA-512 hashing algorithm is used to encrypt voter information at all stages, ensuring that private information is made secure.
# This is especially useful where voters need to give personal identification for verification purposes.

# Imports and dependicies include the Algorand Python SDK, the Python Hashlib library, and the Python Matplotlib library.
