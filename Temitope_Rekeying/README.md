# REKEYING WITH ALGORAND 

One of the unique stuff about Algorand is the ability to rekey your public Algorand addresses! This means you can have your own name at the start of a new public Algorand address and secure it to an existing or new private key you generated securely!


It is assumed you already have a working Python environment configured. Next we need to make sure py-algorand-sdk is installed. 

From a terminal type the following PIP command.
`pip install py-algorand-sdk`

You'd also have to connect to a node, or if you have sandbox running locally, then it's cool.
