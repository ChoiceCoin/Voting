# Voting
This is a repository for voting software built using Choice Coin. Our voting software is centered around Decentralized Decisions, an open-source voting software that allows organizations to make decisions in a distributed manner. 

# Voting on Algorand
Choice Coin has successfully developed and deployed several models for voting on the Algorand blockchain.

# Voting on Ethereum
As of December 2022, Choice Coin is focusing on developing voting protocols on the Ethereum. [Topic in the Ethereum Research Forum](https://ethresear.ch/t/voting-on-ethereum/14467).

# OSS Rewards for Contributions
As the largest OSS project on Algorand Choice Coin strives to excel in open source innovation. Choice Coin is currently focusing on rewarding contributions to this Repository and especially encouraging women to contribute. We recently made 6,000,000.00 Choice available specifically to women to build on Algorand. Additioanlly, Choice Coin commonly hosts bash style hackathons to reward developers and makes Bronze Badge awards available to developers for making significant contributions to the Choice Coin Voting Repository.
